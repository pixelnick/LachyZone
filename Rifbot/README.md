Basic bot for Tibia v7.4

Program support edited Tibia 7.4 (included *dll) such as Iriana.net (ThoraOT), RealisticWar and in some cases Tibians.org not at all.

- Hold target, Anti Paralyze, Auto Hur;
- Lighthack, advertising, Auto Mana;
- Runemaker (player logout), Anti-Idle;
- Food Eater, Mc Hotkeys, Sd Combo;

    - use with me
    - use with target
    - use with crosshairs
    - amulet 3081
    - antipush 3031, 3492
